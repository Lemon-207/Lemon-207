- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aakash Hariram!
- ðŸ“š Currently doing undergraduate degree in B. Tech Electronics and Computer Engineering at VIT Chennai.
- ðŸ‘€ I have a very deep passion towards learning about computer programming and anything related to it makes me excited and pumped!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C programming, and I know only Python, C and C++ for now. BUT don't judge me I'm still a beginner who wants to excel at this field!
- ðŸ“ˆ My future plans are to cultivate more knowledge and be proficient in multiple languages in order to adapt to the industrial needs! Hoping to learn about web development and game development! 
- ðŸ“« Go to my profile for connecting with me!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy coding difficult problems even though they split my head apart! I wonder if this is what they call pure love for coding? :D
